## Name

Red Arrow

## Description

Red Arrow is a Ruby bindings of Apache Arrow. Red Arrow is based on GObject Introspection.

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is an in-memory columnar data store. It's used by many products for data analytics.

[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) is a middleware for language bindings of C library. GObject Introspection can generate language bindings automatically at runtime.

Red Arrow uses [Arrow GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib) and [gobject-introspection gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gobject-introspection) to generate Ruby bindings of Apache Arrow.

Arrow GLib is a C wrapper for [Arrow C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp). GObject Introspection can't use Arrow C++ directly. Arrow GLib is a bridge between Arrow C++ and GObject Introspection.

gobject-introspection gem is a Ruby bindings of GObject Introspection. Red Arrow uses GObject Introspection via gobject-introspection gem.
